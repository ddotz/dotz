// Where an answer and a lane go on Discord, as pure decisions (tested in threads.test.ts). The rule table in MODE.md
// ("Threads") describes the same behaviour for the model; the gateway applies it here so it holds whatever the model writes.
//
//   owner writes ...                         -> the answer / the work goes ...
//   top-level in chat, dm or a work channel  -> a reply to that message in the same channel
//   inside a thread or a lane channel        -> the same thread or channel, no reply reference (unless newer messages came in between)
//   a Discord reply to a thread's starter    -> into that thread
//   long work (a lane) from a work channel   -> a thread on the owner's own message in that channel
//   long work (a lane) from a thread         -> that thread becomes the lane's thread
//   long work (a lane) from chat             -> a new work channel (chat gets one pointer line)
