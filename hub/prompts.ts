// The orchestrator's prompt queue. Every delivered prompt remembers where its answer goes; prompts are matched back by
// their text as omp starts them (FIFO, so identical texts still pair in order). Unanswered prompts are kept on disk
// (the earlier secretary's `last_handled`: a message counts as handled when it is answered, not when it arrives), so a restart mid-turn
// replays them on boot.
//
// An owner message that arrives while the orchestrator is mid-turn is steered into that turn instead of waiting
// behind it (owner 2026-10-17: "순차적으로 처리하던데 ... 바로 답변이 안오는데"): the orchestrator answers it with dotz_send
// and carries on. If the turn ends before it was answered, it is delivered again as a normal prompt. A message that
// was answered with a reply_to (dotz_send or the turn's auto answer) is never delivered again, not at turn end and not
// by the restart replay.
//
// The answer goes out only when it is ready (owner 2026-10-20: "답변은 준비되고 해야해. 먼저하면 안됨"): a dotz_send to the
// channel the running turn answers, sent before that turn's final answer, is held (holdEarly) and posted together with
// the final answer, ahead of it. Only a full answer to a message steered in mid-turn goes out at once; progress is the one
// edited progress message (update_key), never a new text.
//
// An answer is never dropped for want of a pairing (owner 2026-10-20: three finished answers to web messages never arrived).
// OmO consumes a queued message inside the running agent run and starts runs of its own (a finished task worker wakes the
// session, also right after a gateway restart), so a user frame that matches no delivered prompt, or a run that started
// without one, is normal there: an unmatched user frame leaves the unanswered prompt in place, a prompt that finished is
// released when the orchestrator goes idle (a later run is a new one), and an answer with no prompt goes only by a label: the request
// a provider error stopped, the link of the worker that woke the run, or the target that same woken run already delivered to. Everything
// else goes to deps.home (the session's own primary target, "web" for main) with no reply id; the recency of another conversation's
// messages never picks a conversation, and a real answer is never dropped.
//
// Work another session handed over (`from`) is never posted: its final answer, and a woken worker's answer to it, go to deps.handBack.
//
// A turn that hands code work to a background task worker ends with exactly `[later]` (MODE Routing; owner 2026-10-21: a long inline turn kept every next message waiting a median 238 s): its prompt stays open (deferred) with nothing sent,
// and the answer of the run the worker's result wakes (no prompt of ours) goes to that worker's request. The word is read by meaning (tone.ts laterParts): words around it reach the owner as a note that settles nothing, and the prompt stays open.
//
// A worker is linked to its request when it is spawned (WorkLink, kept on disk next to pending.json): every worker a turn spawned
// gets its own receipt line, and the answer of the run its result woke goes to exactly that request, whatever order workers finish
// in. A follow-up that a turn passed to a worker (task_send) and deferred joins that worker's link (`also`): the answer replies to the
// oldest request of the worker and closes the others. A worker spawned by a run with no request stays linked to no message. A wake counts only for the run it woke: a result read inside a prompted turn,
// or left over when a run ended, stays out of the next run's pairing (2026-11-04 13:22 UTC: one such wake moved every later answer
// one request back), and its request is asked again once. a run no
// worker woke closes no request, and an answer no label explains is posted at home with no reply link.
